1. Summary of the report.
This research investigated the sleeping hour of some selected animal species and
carry out rigorous explorative analysis by using principal component analysis. Also,
this research investigated the number of principal components that explain larger
variability within the dataset and determine the contribution of each variables to
the principal component.
2. Describe the strengths of the report.
This research applied dimension reduction and showed further discussion for the
results properly.
3. Describe the weaknesses of the report.
The figure legend is not presented for most of the figures although thorough
description has been made for each figure. The meaning of each tag in the figure
should be clearly presented. Moreover, the tag within some plot are heavily
overlapped.
4. Evaluation on Clarity and quality of writing (1-5)
Point 4. The report is clearly written and well organized in structure. The reference
is properly cited. No obvious grammar error could be found. If possible, please add
detail figure legend for each figure.
5. Evaluation on Technical Quality (1-5)
Point 5. The results are technically sound. Claims are well-supported by theoretical
analysis or experimental results. Researchers could replicate these results by
following the description.
6. Overall rating: (5- My vote as the best-report. 4- A good report. 3- An average one.
2- below average. 1- a poorly written one).
Rating: 4
7. Confidence on your assessment (1-3) (3- I have carefully read the paper and
checked the results, 2- I just browse the paper without checking the details, 1- My
assessment can be wrong)
Confidence: 2

Summary of the project:
The exhibition format of this project is a report. In the project, the authors used
PCA(principal component analysis) to analyse two data set, Animal sleeping and Heart
disease, to determine the number of principal components required to explain most information
of the original data.
Strengths and Weaknesses:
The authors introduce PCA and how to find principal components and how to calculate
variance of each principal components. They find a good topic: the relationship
between variables and principal component and how many principal components are
needed. However, I do not really understand what Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 8 are
trying to express. Maybe the authors can give more details or comments about them.
Also, I think the methods applied to two dataset are similar, maybe one is enough. Finally,
the report only give the conclusion based on numerical experience but no other
detailed explanation. I am interested how to determine how many principal components
required without any experience result. In other words, given a data matrix, is there any
other way to predict the required principal components in advance?
Evaluation on Clarity and quality of writing: 3
I think the organization of report is not so good. Firstly, the author does not use a format
of a technical report and the report is a little long. The layout of text and graphics is
not good. Also, The author failed to give a detailed explanation to some figures shown
in the report.
Evaluation on Technical Quality: 2
The technique used in the report are reasonable. And I think the evaluation is appropriate.
But I think the method used is repeated. I think it is appropriate to use two
methods on one data set, but it is redundant to use one method in two dataset.
Overall Rate: 2
Confidence on your assessment: 2
