• Summary of the report
The authors explore the relationship between the genetic variation of peoples and their geographical variation by applying some dimensionality reduction methods on the SNPs data and predict the regions where people come from through random forest method.
• Describe the strengths of the report
The authors provide the clear visualization of the high dimensional SNPs data using different methods, like PCA, MDS and t-SNE, and also compared the accuracy of predictions with or without dimensionality reduction.
• Describe the weaknesses of the report
No

•	Summary: 
 	This report analyzes the character relationship in Journey to the West by PCA and MDS. Given the character-event matrix, PCA reveals the key characters by principal components. And by MDA, the relationship among characters is visualized.
•	Strengths and weaknesses:
 	It applied statistical techniques in Journey to the West successfully. In PCA, master Tripitake (’ 唐僧’) and his three apprentices Monkey King (’ 孙悟空’), Pigsy(’ 猪八戒’) and Sandy (’ 沙僧’) don't appear in the top two principal component, which is an interesting phenomenon. Maybe this phenomenon could be explained if there are more preprocessing. When dealing with MDS, this report seems applied the metric MDS, according to the section 5.1. However, the matrix constructed in section 5.2 is like the dissimilarity rather than the distance, which might be improved. Plus, Figure 3 and 5 could be more obvious. Actually, i'm really curious why 孙悟空 is far from 猪八戒 but closed to 狮驼岭老妖. 
•	Evaluation on Clarity and quality of writing: 2
 	The abstract could be an independent part rather than the first section. Table 3's title should be the second principal component. Figure 5 seems not a community network.

• Summary of the report
The authors performed statistical methods including PCA and MDS method with the tool of R studio to analysis the correlation between events and characters in the Journey to the West. Theyfind that the novel is developed on different small stories of the whole narration, and in each single story, different new characters have been generated. 

•	Describe the strengths of the report
I really enjoy this report. Their format and the content are great. They propose a interesting problem and study it carefully.
•	Describe the weaknesses of the report
  Maybe some of the introduction to the PCA and MDS can be reduced.

Cheng Haoyi:

(a) Summary:
This report analyzes the relationship between events and characters in the famous novel Journey to the West. They use data reduction algorithms, like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), to achieve the text analysis. Throughout the whole project report, they briefly describe the dataset structures, then they introduce the classical PCA and MDS, respectively.
Then, they compare the results of applying these two methods to Journey to the West with Dream of Red Chamber, both classical PCA and MDS can lead to the same conclusion that the network of characters in Journey to the West is looser than that in Dream of Red Chamber.
(b) Strength:
They choose tables, graphs, or graph of community networks to help explain the results, which seems to be visually great! Readers can clearly grasp the key features and follow the conclusions that authors make in paper.
(c) Weakness:
The idea of this report is so clear, but I think it can be better if the report can give a final conclusion at the end rather than only show it in the abstract.
(d) Evaluation on Clarity and quality of writing: 4.5
