# Here you can
# 1. import necessary python packages for your strategy
# 2. Load your own facility files containing functions, trained models, extra data, etc for later use
# 3. Set some global constants
# Note:
# 1. You should put your facility files in the same folder as this strategy.py file
# 2. When load files, ALWAYS use relative path such as "data/facility.pickle"
# DO NOT use absolute path such as "C:/Users/Peter/Documents/project/data/facility.pickle"
asset_index = 1  # only consider BTC (the **second** crypto currency in dataset)

# Here is your main strategy function
# Note:
# 1. DO NOT modify the function parameters (time, data, etc.)
# 2. The strategy function AWAYS returns two things - position and memory:
# 2.1 position is a np.array (length 4) indicating your desired position of four crypto currencies next minute
# 2.2 memory is a class containing the information you want to save currently for future use


def handle_bar(counter,  # a counter for number of minute bars that have already been tested
               time,  # current time in string format such as "2018-07-30 00:30:00"
               data,  # data for current minute bar (in format 2)
               init_cash,  # your initial cash, a constant
               transaction,  # transaction ratio, a constant
               cash_balance,  # your cash balance at current minute
               crypto_balance,  # your crpyto currency balance at current minute
               total_balance,  # your total balance at current minute
               position_current,  # your position for 4 crypto currencies at this minute
               memory  # a class, containing the information you saved so far
               ):
    # Here you should explain the idea of your strategy briefly in the form of Python comment.
    # You can also attach facility files such as text & image & table in your team folder to illustrate your idea

    # The idea of my strategy:
    # Buy 10 BTC at the very beginning and hold it to the end.
    position = position_current  # load current position
    position[asset_index] = 10  # buy 10 BTC at the very beginning and hold it to the end
    return position, memory
