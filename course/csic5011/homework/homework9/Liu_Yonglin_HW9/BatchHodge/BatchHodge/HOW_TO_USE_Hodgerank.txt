To run the experiment on your paired comparison dataset:

1. Load your paired comparison data (e.g. incomp.mat file contains 1682 paired comparisons extracted from 38200 data). 
The first column in incomp.mat is the video with better quality and the second column is the video with worse quality.

2. Run \Hodgerank.m to get the score and inconsistency of each video.
