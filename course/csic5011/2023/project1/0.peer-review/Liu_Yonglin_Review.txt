Human Migration History: A Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Perspective.

Summary:
The report investigates the human migration history from a statistical perspective using genetic data, specifically analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data by employing Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and comparing the results with Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). The study aims to provide insights into human migration patterns and contribute to the ongoing discussion on the origin and evolution of anatomically modern humans. The results show that all the clustering results coincide with the African origin hypothesis.

Strengths:
The report uses a robust statistical method, PCA, to analyze genetic data and compares the results with other methods, MDS and t-SNE. The study aims to provide insights into human migration patterns and contributes to the ongoing discussion on the origin and evolution of anatomically modern humans. The report is well organized and well-written, with a clear introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections.

Weaknesses:
The report does not discuss potential limitations of the PCA method or the assumptions made during the analysis.

Clarity and quality of writing (1-5): 5
The report is well-written and well-organized, with a clear introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections.

Ancestry Prediction via Dimensionality Reduction Techniques on SNPs Data.

Summary:

This report presents a study on using dimensionality reduction techniques to perform ancestry prediction from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data. The authors used several popular techniques including PCA, MDS, t-SNE, ISOMAP, LLE, UMAP, robust PCA, and random projection to reduce the high-dimensional SNP data. They demonstrated that random projection performed the best when separating people from seven different regions. Finally, they showed that t-SNE could be used for ancestry prediction in an additional 1000 Genomes Project dataset.

Strengths:

The report provides a detailed and comprehensive study on using dimensionality reduction techniques for ancestry prediction from SNP data. The authors clearly explained the methodology, presented the results, and provided a thorough evaluation of the approach. The figures and tables are well-organized and effectively communicate the findings. The reproducible codes are also provided with the report, making it possible for other researchers to replicate the results.

Weaknesses:

The report could have included a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach. Additionally, the report could have provided more context and background information on the 1000 Genomes Project dataset and the exploratory cleaned dataset. Finally, the report could have used more examples to clarify some of the technical terms used.

Clarity and Quality of Writing: 4

The report is well-written and well-organized, with clear and concise explanations of the methodology and results. The figures and tables are effective in communicating the findings. There are no major issues with style and grammar, although there are a few minor typos, such as "labelling" instead of "labeling" and "tSNE" instead of "t-SNE".

Technical Quality: 4

The results are technically sound, and the authors provided reproducible codes for the study. The experiments are well thought out and convincing, and the authors assessed both the strengths and weaknesses of their approach. However, the report could have included a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach, and more context and background information on the datasets could have been provided.

Overall rating: 4

The report is a good one and presents a comprehensive study on using dimensionality reduction techniques for ancestry prediction from SNP data. The authors provided a thorough evaluation of the approach and presented the findings effectively. The reproducible codes also make it possible for other researchers to replicate the results.
