This work is primarily constituted of two parts, which are jointly accomplished by the two authors. For
the first part, Mingyang Chen reproduces the framework of using CNN to predict the return trend of 2-D stock
data. Specifically, Mingyang reconstructs the baseline models introduced in the original paper and verifies the
performance, robustness and interpretability of the model from several aspects. For the second part, Bo Huang
explores the feasibility of replacing the CNN-based feature extractor by adapting Masked Autoencoder (MAE)
and self-supervised learning in this task. Specifically, Bo explicitly introduces the adaptation process and studies
the influence of mask ratio on the prediction performance. Finally, the paperwork is organized and compiled by
the two authors equally.
