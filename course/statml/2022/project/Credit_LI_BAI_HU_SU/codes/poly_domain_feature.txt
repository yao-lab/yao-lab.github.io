To run the code of polynomial features and domain knowledge features:

python poly_domain_feature.py

The training loss and the Cross Validation scores will be displayed. 
The main part of the code is two functions:
train, test = poly_process(train, test)
X = domain_knowledge(X)

You can call this two functions to generate desired features
