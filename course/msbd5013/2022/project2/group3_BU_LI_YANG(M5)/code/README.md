    ======================== data ========================
    1. Dataset can be retrieved from:
        https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data
        https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-uncertainty/data
    ======================== code ========================
    2. Each training process will generate data.pickle, logs file, weights file in each directory correspondingly (we do not upload data.pickle file and weights file, since the files are too large).
    3. You can run each jupyter notebook correspondingly to obtain the training result.
    ===================== submission =====================
    4. submissions folder contains result files of our models for two tasks.
