The files in this filefolder is the codes & reports of the final project of MSBD 5013, 2021-2022.

The project is about the replication of paper: (Re-)Imag(in)ing Price Trends

The filefolder "codes" includes the jypyter notebooks of all the models we have implemented, including:
	HOG-Based model
	Baseline CNN model
	CNN model with 32 kernels
	CNN model with 2 layers
	CNN model without dropout
	CNN model without batch normalization
	CNN model without Xavier initialization
	CNN model using ReLU as the activation function
	CNN model using 2×2 as the size of Max-Pooling
	CNN model with filter size of 3×3
	CNN model with Dilation/Stride (1,1)/(3,1)

Filefolder "codes" also include the codes of interpreting the CNN Model by visualization.

The filefolder "report_n_slides" includes the poster of this project, as well as the presentation slides.
