# CSIC 5011 (Spring'20) Project-1 by Neel Kanth Kundu and Avik Kumar Das
# Performance Improvement of FNN based Image Classification using PCA

This repository contains the google colab notebook for the experiments done in the project.
We use PCA to reduce the dimension od MNIST dataset and then use it in a FNN for image clasiification.
For a given network architecture, by using PCA we were able to reduce the number of parameters of the FNN 
which leads to superior clasification accuracy and faster runtime when compared to vanilla-FNN.
